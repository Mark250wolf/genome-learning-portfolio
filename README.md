# genome-learning-portfolio
A public genetics learning portfolio documenting my progress in molecular biology, genome science, and CRISPR research through written explanations and video breakdowns.
Genome Learning Portfolio

A public learning portfolio documenting my academic development in genetics and molecular biology, with a long-term focus on genome science and CRISPR-Cas9 research.

About This Repository

This repository serves as a structured record of my progress through foundational genetics concepts using:

Genetics: From Genes to Genomes (Goldberg, 2023)

Biology and Chemistry coursework at UTRGV

Independent study and concept breakdown videos

The goal of this project is to:

Build strong theoretical foundations in genetics

Develop the ability to clearly explain complex biological systems

Prepare for future research opportunities in genome editing and molecular biology

Structure

This repository will include:

Written chapter summaries

Concept breakdowns (e.g., Mendelian genetics, transcription/translation, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)

Diagrams and simplified explanations

Video walkthroughs explaining key ideas

Reflections on learning progress

Long-Term Objective

To build a strong conceptual base for research in:

Genome engineering

CRISPR-Cas9 systems

Molecular genetics

Systems biology
